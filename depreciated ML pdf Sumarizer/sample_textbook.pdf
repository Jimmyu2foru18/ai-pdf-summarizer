(unsupervised learning, as well as common algorithms and their applications. Machine learning) Tj
0 -20 Td
(is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and) Tj

(1.1 What is Machine Learning?) Tj
0 -30 Td
/F1 12 Tf
(Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to) Tj
0 -20 Td
(automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.) Tj
0 -20 Td
(The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience,) Tj
0 -20 Td
(or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.) Tj
0 -30 Td
(Example 1: Email spam filtering is a classic application of machine learning. The system learns) Tj
0 -20 Td
(from labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails to classify new, unseen emails.) Tj
0 -30 Td
(Example 2: Netflix uses machine learning to recommend movies based on your viewing history) Tj
0 -20 Td
(and preferences, improving its suggestions over time as it learns more about your tastes.) Tj

(1.2 Types of Machine Learning) Tj
0 -30 Td
/F1 12 Tf
(There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning,) Tj
0 -20 Td
(and reinforcement learning. Each type has different approaches and applications.) Tj
0 -30 Td
(For example, in supervised learning, algorithms are trained using labeled data. The model learns) Tj
0 -20 Td
(to predict outputs based on input features. Common algorithms include linear regression and) Tj

(CHAPTER 2: Neural Networks) Tj
0 -30 Td
/F1 12 Tf
(Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed) Tj
0 -20 Td
(to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception,) Tj
0 -20 Td
(labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors,) Tj
0 -20 Td
(into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.) Tj

(The perceptron is the simplest neural network, consisting of a single neuron. It takes several) Tj
